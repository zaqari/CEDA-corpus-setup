# Setting up corpora for use in Convergence-Entropy Data Analysis (CEDA) processing

The following are sets of scripts that can be used to take various file formats and prepare them for CEDA-style analyses. 

CEDA is a python implementation of the Entropy conVergence Metric (EVM; also called the convergence-entropy metric, or CEM) described in Rosen & Dale 2023. Please cite the use of the CEDA package via the following:
